# Road to a React (Front-end) Master
## what is this project for
This is to record me, a junior fullstack software engineer, to learn **React** source code and finnaly, even contribute to it!

**React** has been the most used tool in my work and I had great interest into it, thus I wish to understand some stuff under the hood, and to make me calm when I encounter some bugs. 

What is most important, isn't it so cool to add an achievement of contributing to a 200k :star: in resume? (please don't judge me, I know it sounds materialism :joy:, but I really need a more profitable and challenging job right now).
