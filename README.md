# Road to a React (Front-end) Master
## what is this project for
This is to record me, a junior fullstack software engineer, to learn **React** source code and finnaly, even contribute to it!

**React** has been the most used tool in my work and I had great interest into it, thus I wish to understand some stuff under the hood, and to make me calm when I encounter some bugs. 

I know it sounds a bit shallow, but contributing to a 200k⭐ project would look so cool on a resume — and honestly, I need a more rewording role and am ready for new challenges.
