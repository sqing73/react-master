# Road to a React (Front-end) Master
## What is this project for
This is to record me, a junior fullstack software engineer, to learn **React** source code and finnaly, even contribute to it!

**React** has been the most used tool in my work and I had great interest into it, thus I wish to understand some stuff under the hood, and to make me calm when I encounter some bugs. 

I know it sounds a bit shallow, but contributing to a 200k⭐ project would look so cool on a resume — and honestly, I need a more rewording role and am ready for new challenges.

## What is happening now
Reading some online resources, mostly a blog about **React** source code by Kasong and the classic book *You don't know JS* (a pretty good book worth reading - it made me realize what lies beneath simplicity could be incredibly complex). Taking notes when I'm reading them and they can be found in **days*.md** files.

## What will happen tomorrow
For the annual goal, hopefully, we can get ramp up and get familiar with at least **React** react core library, react-dom renderer and scheduler within two to three months. Then I will skim through some recent merges and open tickets that maybe I can get hands dirty.
